# Getting started with `rx`

These are tutorial files demonstrating how to use
[rx](https://github.com/run-rx/rx).  To get started:

1. Install [rx](https://github.com/run-rx/rx), following the instructions in
   README.md.
2. Clone this repo: `git clone git@github.com:run-rx/getting-started.git`
3. Initialize rx in this directory: `cd getting-started; rx init`.

Each tutorial file (`NN-<description>.py`) has documentation at the top about
how to run it. The tutorials assume you have rx installed and initialized.
