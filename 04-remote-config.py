"""Customizing your remote configuration.

rx gives you a lot of flexibility in terms of RAM, disk, CPU, and GPU options
on your remote machine. (Or, at least, it will!)

You can check out your current configuration by looking at .rx/remotes/default.
When you run `rx init`, rx uses that to provision a bog-standard Python 3.11
instance.

However, the files in .rx/remotes are simply starter templates and you can
create any configuration you want.

For example, try running this file (04-remote-config.py) with the remote
instance you've been using so far. This file is valid Python 2 code, but not
Python 3, so You should see something like:

  $ rx python 04-remote-config.py
    File "/Users/k/gitroot/rx/samples/04-remote-config.py", line 14
      print "Hello from Python 2."
      ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
  SyntaxError: Missing parentheses in call to 'print'. Did you mean print(...)?

rx can pull any public docker image, so we'll create a remote machine with
Python 2. Create `.rx/remotes/python2-config` with the following contents:

  {
    "image": {
      "docker": "python:2.7.7"
    }
  }

Now tell rx that you want to use a different remote machine by running `rx init`
again:

  $ rx init --remote=python2-config

Now if you run this script, you should see:

  $ rx python 04-remote-config.py
  Hello from Python 2.

To switch back to Python 3, run `rx init` again without any flags and it'll go
back to using the config `default` is symlinked to.
"""

print "Hello from Python 2."
